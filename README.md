Compass View for Android

1. Introduction

This view can locate a lot of circle rings inside it. In each ring, we can add multiple words with same space holder in length of the ring. So it results multiple rings with multiple words in each ring ;)

You can customize number of rings, and word properties (font-size, color, leading character count...) in each ring.

Enjoy it !
